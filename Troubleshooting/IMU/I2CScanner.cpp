/*
    Raspberry Pi Pico I2C scanner.

    This scans the I2C bus and prints every address that responds.

    Wiring for i2c0:
        SDA -> GP4
        SCL -> GP5

    For your MPU6050, the expected address is usually:
        0x68

    Sometimes it can be:
        0x69

    If nothing is found, check:
        - VCC
        - GND
        - SDA/SCL swapped
        - loose wires
        - whether the sensor board needs pull-up resistors
